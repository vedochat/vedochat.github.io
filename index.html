                <p class="text-center" style="padding-left: 50px;padding-right: 50px;">Born and raised in India, and currently living in the UK, I am a well-travelled individual who likes to think deeply and appreciate the world around him.<br><br>An Engineer by profession, I have executed and led critical project deliverables in the automotive industry, home appliances, AR devices, industrial software, and currently, in aerospace and defense. Being highly skilled in Mechanical Engineering Design and Computational Simulations, I am also adept at Software Development, Data Science, Machine Learning and Cloud Computing through short stints at work and part-time hustles.<br><br>My biggest achievement so far is that I am the primary author of a design patent registered at the European Patent Office. I have work experience across India, Germany, Italy and the UK. I have A2 Level German Language certification and I have picked up basic Italian while I was living there.<br><br>In my free time, I like to research about the latest developments in Artificial Intelligence, read various books about philosophy, psychology and numerous other genres. I like to stay physically and mentally fit through my practices of light Yoga, Pranayama (breathing exercises), and a form of meditation known as Heartfulness meditation. I volunteer with the Heartfulness Institute, which is a registered charity in many countries including the UK, and I conduct various talks and promotional events to increase the awareness and appreciation of meditation as a means to deal with the complex and confusing world around us.<br><br>I am currently working on my leadership and management skills. I have taken professional coaching to develop personal excellence within my own sphere of influence, while I am also targeting to get certified as a Project Management Professional.<br><br>I do not draw boundaries between personal and professional life, and I believe in being my whole person in all my engagements, because this, to me helps in promoting a healthy culture of self-expression at work, which to me is the essential for a mentally healthy team.</p>
